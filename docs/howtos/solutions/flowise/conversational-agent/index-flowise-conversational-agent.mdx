In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a conversational agent with Redis using [Flowise](https://flowiseai.com/). Flowise is a powerful, open-source, and user-friendly AI platform that allows you to build and deploy conversational agents (and many other LLM flows) quickly using a simple and intuitive interface.

## What is a conversational agent?

Normal LLMs (Large Language Models) like GPT-4 are general-purpose models trained on diverse datasets to perform a wide range of language-related tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and more.

Conversational agents, however, are more sophisticated and designed specifically for managing conversations effectively. They often integrate multiple specialized agents or modules to handle specific tasks, providing a comprehensive and interactive experience.

### Example

Question:

`Who won the latest 2024 elections in India?`

Normal LLM (GPT-4) response:

`Sorry, I don't have real-time access to current events or updates, including recent election outcomes. To find out who won the latest 2024 elections in India, I recommend checking the most recent news on a reliable news website or a trusted media outlet.`

Conversational agent response:

`Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won the most seats in the latest 2024 elections in India.`

- A normal LLM cannot answer questions about the latest news, projects, etc., as it is not trained on real-time data.
- In contrast, a conversational agent can handle such queries because it integrates an LLM at its core along with other specialized agents to manage specific tasks. In our conversational agent example, we will use `ChatOpenAI` combined with a `SearchAPI` agent to answer questions about the latest news, weather, and other real-time information.
- The [SearchAPI](https://www.searchapi.io/) agent is a specialized module capable of fetching data from Google search results, enabling our conversational agent to provide up-to-date and relevant answers.
- We can use multiple specialized agents like `SearchAPI`, `Calculator`, `Python Interpreter`, `Custom Tool`, `Custom Function/ API`, etc., to enhance the capabilities of our conversational agent. LLM will pick the right tool to handle specific types of queries.

In the following sections, we will guide you through the process of setting up Redis with Flowise, configuring the necessary nodes, and testing your conversational agent.

## Setup Flowise

There are [different ways](https://docs.flowiseai.com/getting-started) to install Flowise. For this tutorial, we'll use the docker compose method to install Flowise.

3. **Save and name your chatflow:** Click on the save icon. A prompt will appear asking you to name your chatflow. Enter a meaningful name that describes the purpose of your chatflow.

![save-new-chatflow](./images/save-new-chatflow.png)

By following these steps, you will create a empty chatflow in Flowise, setting the foundation for building your conversational agent

## Adding a conversational agent node

![01-drag-conversational-agent](./images/01-drag-conversational-agent.gif)

1. **Drag the conversational agent node:** From the `Agents` section in the Flowise interface, drag the `Conversational Agent` node into your chatflow workspace.

2. **Modify additional parameters:** In the node's interface, you have the option to modify the system message prompt. This prompt is used to set the context for the chatbot, ensuring it understands the specific domain or behavior you want it to exhibit. Also, click on the save icon to ensure your modifications are not lost.

By following these steps, you will have successfully added a conversational agent node to your chatflow and set the initial context for your chatbot. In subsequent sections, we will integrate additional nodes and configure the chatbot to interact with Redis and other specialized agents.

## Adding a SearchAPI node

![02-drag-search-api-tool](./images/02-drag-search-api-tool.gif)

1. **Drag the SearchAPI node:** From the `Tools` section in the Flowise interface, drag the `SearchAPI` node into your chatflow workspace. The SearchAPI node acts as an agent capable of fetching data from Google search results.

2. **Connect to conversational agent node:** Connect the SearchAPI node to the Conversational Agent node by drawing a line from the output of the Conversational Agent node to the input of the SearchAPI node. This connection allows the conversational agent to utilize the search capabilities provided by the SearchAPI.

3. **Set the SearchAPI key:** In the interface of the SearchAPI node, enter your SearchAPI key. This key is necessary for the node to authenticate and perform search queries.

4. **Combine multiple tools:** You can enhance the capabilities of your Conversational Agent by adding multiple tools. For example, you can integrate `SearchAPI`, `Calculator`, `Python Interpreter` or even `Custom Tool` node. The Conversational Agent will automatically select the appropriate tool to handle specific types of queries. For this demo, we will be just adding `SearchAPI` node. Click on the save icon to ensure all configurations and connections are stored.

By following these steps, you will have successfully integrated a SearchAPI node into your chatflow, let's add other nodes in next steps.

## Adding a ChatOpenAI node

![03-drag-chat-open-ai](./images/03-drag-chat-open-ai.gif)

1. **Drag the ChatOpenAI node:** From the `Chat Models` section in the Flowise interface, drag the `ChatOpenAI` node into your chatflow workspace.

2. **Create an OpenAI key:** If you haven't already created an OpenAI key, do so by clicking on the `Create New` menu within the node's interface. This key is essential for authenticating requests to the OpenAI API.

3. **Choose a model:** Select a model like GPT-3, GPT-4 ..etc from the available options. The model determines the behavior and capabilities of your conversational agent.

4. **Set the temperature:** The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the model's responses. It ranges from 0 to 1:

   - Low temperature (e.g., 0.2): Produces more deterministic and focused responses.
   - High temperature (e.g., 0.8): Produces more creative and varied responses.

5. **Set additional parameters:** Configure other parameters such as `Max Tokens`, which defines the maximum number of tokens (words or parts of words) the model can generate in a single response. Ensure you save your chatflow regularly to preserve all changes.

By following these steps, you will have successfully added and configured a ChatOpenAI node in your chatflow. This node will serve as the core conversational engine, leveraging OpenAI's powerful language models to generate responses. In subsequent sections, we will further enhance your chatflow with additional nodes.

## Adding a Redis chat memory node

![04-drag-redis-chat-memory](./images/04-drag-redis-chat-memory.gif)

1. **Drag the Redis chat memory node:** From the `Memory` section in the Flowise interface, drag the `Redis Backed Chat Memory` node into your chatflow workspace.

2. **Choose Redis connection key:** In the node's interface, choose or create a connection key for the Redis instance. This connection key will be used to store and retrieve chat memory data.

3. **Set chat key prefix:** In the additional parameters section, you can set a chat key prefix. This prefix helps in organizing and identifying the chat memory records stored in Redis. Finally, save your chatflow to ensure all configurations and connections are persisted.

:::info
Why Use Redis for chat memory?

**Speed:**
Redis is an in-memory data store, which means it can quickly read and write data, providing low-latency access to chat history. This speed is crucial for maintaining a seamless and responsive conversational experience.

**Persistence:**
Redis also supports persistence, allowing chat data to be stored permanently. This means even if the application restarts or crashes, the chat history can be recovered, ensuring continuity in conversations.
:::

By following these steps, you will have successfully added a Redis chat memory node to your chatflow. This integration ensures that your conversational agent can remember and utilize past interactions, enhancing the overall user experience. In the next section, we will test the chatflow setup.

## Testing the chatflow

![05-test-chatflow](./images/05-test-chatflow.gif)

1. **Start the chat:** Click on the chat icon to interact with your newly created conversational agent.
2. **Ask questions:** Test the functionality by asking latest questions such as, `What is Redis Data Integration (RDI)?`
3. **Check the response:** Evaluate the response provided by the chatflow. Ensure that it correctly fetches and presents information based on the connected tools (e.g., SearchAPI).
   Click on the tool button above the chatflow response message to view details of the tools used.
   ![chatflow-tool-usage](./images/chatflow-tool-usage.png)

By following these steps, you will be able to test and validate the functionality of your chatflow, ensuring that your conversational agent is working as expected and providing accurate and relevant responses.

## Verifying chatflow data with RedisInsight

[RedisInsight](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/) is a powerful GUI tool that allows you to interact with Redis data visually. It provides an easy way to verify and manage the persisted data in your Redis instance.

![redis-insight-chatflow](./images/redis-insight-chatflow.png)

**Example of stored chat data**

In our example, Redis stores the chat data in a list with each entry representing a message in the conversation. Here are samples of how these entries might look:

```json title="Redis List"
[
  {
    "type": "ai",
    "data": {
      "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won the most seats in the latest 2024 elections in India. However, they fell short of securing an outright majority in parliament.",
      "tool_calls": [],
      "invalid_tool_calls": [],
      "additional_kwargs": {},
      "response_metadata": {}
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "human",
    "data": {
      "content": "Who won the latest 2024 elections in India?",
      "additional_kwargs": {},
      "response_metadata": {}
    }
  }
]
```

- **Type**: Indicates the origin of the message. It can be either ai (response generated by the AI) or human (message input by the user).

- **Data**:
  - **Content**: The main text of the message. For AI responses, this is the generated answer. For human messages, this is the user's input.
  - **Tool calls**: A list of calls made to external tools or APIs during the generation of the response.
  - **Invalid tool calls**: A list of tool calls that failed or were invalid.
  - **Additional kwargs**: Additional keyword arguments that might have been used during the message processing.
  - **Response metadata**: Metadata associated with the response, such as timestamps or processing details.

By using RedisInsight, you can easily monitor and manage the data generated by your conversational agent, ensuring that all interactions are correctly logged and stored in Redis. This can be invaluable for debugging, improving the agent's performance, and maintaining a high-quality user experience.
